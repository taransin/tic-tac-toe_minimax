# Documentation
The file relazione.pdf contains the whole documentation. At the moment, its content is in italian and I'm not going to add an english version in the near future. The file contains the theory behind the logic: an explanation of the game, a mathematical description (game theory), an ambient analysis where the intelligent agent has to work and how the intelligent agent finds the solution. Both minimax and minimax with alpha-beta pruning are explained. Eventually, it's shown how the logic explained has been implemented in SWI-Prolog.
